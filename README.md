# Linear-Actuator-Modelling-and-Control-Cascade-PID

The project was to do a cascade (position, speed, and current control) PID control to a DC motor attached via a belt drive to a cart moving on a linear guide rail. We built a Simulink model representing the actual system we built. Then we did a cascaded PID control on the model. Then we generated the code for the cascade PID controller from the Simulink model and put it on the microcontroller (Arduino).
